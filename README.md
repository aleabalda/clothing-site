# Clothing Site Clone

The goal of this project is to get experience coding a real life e-commerce website, such as H&M or Zara, and implement important tools such as stripe and whatever else.

## Features

The features of this website should be consistent with whichever clothing site we choose to clone. Typical features will include:

- Shopping Cart
- Favourites
- Account
- Clothing Pages

## Resources

Find some way to display clothes, either through an API of the site that weâ€™re cloning or use images from elsewhere to display pretend clothes. Could also make this feature similar to FB Marketplace or Kijiji where users could upload clothing items to sell online.

## Tools and Technologies

- Next.js
- TailwindCSS
- Python
- Django or Flask
- Some sort of cloud integration

## Plan

1. Watch videos and/or take a course on Next.js to learn it (at least the fundamentals).
2. Watch videos on using Python as a backend, then watch videos on Django or Flask.
3. Create the project.
4. Start coding.
5. When reaching the point to implement Stripe, watch a video on it and read the docs.
